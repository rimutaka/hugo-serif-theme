## How to find the right job

Hiring managers are busy people. Many of them are software developers like yourself. They would rather be coding than looking through another resume. Let's make it easy for them to choose you:

1. Show off your skills by running your code through StackMuncher
2. Set your availability
3. Set your preferences for the type of work and the employer
4. Respond promptly to interesting offers

If you are actively applying for jobs you can include your StackMuncher metrics in your resume. The hiring manager will appreciate the detailed breakdown of your capabilities.
