## About the project

StackMuncher was started by [@rimutaka](https://stackmuncher.com/rimutaka) after he failed a C# dev interview at Xero. He wanted to quantify how well he actually knows .Net and other technologies.

* [All of StackMuncher code](https://github.com/stackmuncher), including most of the back-end is open source
* We are looking for contributors to help us improve the code analysis part and expand the stack
* We mainly use Rust, VueJS and AWS ([full stack report](https://stackmuncher.com/stackmuncher))
* Our database is also open source and can be downloaded from AWS S3
