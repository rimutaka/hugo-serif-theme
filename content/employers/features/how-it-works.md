## How to attract the right software developers

Skilled devs and talented beginners already have jobs and are not actively looking. The best way to get their attention is to present them with an opportunity that matches their skills and interests. How do we know that? We are software developers.

Instead of approaching someone "for a chat" or asking them to sit a test we send developers a very concise message with your job outline and how well they match. The better the match, the more likely they are to apply.

Our metric-based directory cuts through the noise and helps both sides engage only if there is a good fit.
